# Server Networking Task
## IP Address Identification
The IP address of the domain guvi.in was identified using the nslookup command
## CPU and Memory Usage
The CPU and memory usage of the server were checked using the top command. The server was found to be idle with minimal resource usage.
## Connectivity Test
Network connectivity between the server and guvi.in was tested using the ping command. The test was successful with 0% packet loss, confirming proper connectivity.
## Port Availability Check
An application was deployed on guvi.com:9000, but the page was not accessible. The port status was checked using the ss command, and no service was found listening on port 9000.
## Conclusion
Although the application was running, port 9000 was not open, which is why the application could not be accessed through the browser.
